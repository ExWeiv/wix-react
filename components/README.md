## Your React Components

In this folder you will create your own React components. And any React (.tsx) code here will be automatically compiled to JS inside of your Wix sites public/react folder. Some features won't work and may also break the code when working in Wix:

- import 'style.css' won't work basically importing CSS files won't work. Instead place the required styles in a separate CSS file and use that CSS file in your custom element code.
- some third party libraries may not work.
